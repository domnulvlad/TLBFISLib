## Getting started
Install the [Arduino IDE 2.0/1.8](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
Download the [TLBLib](https://github.com/domnulvlad/TLBLib/releases/latest) library and [add it to your Arduino IDE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries#importing-a-zip-library).

**Read the documentation on [the wiki](https://github.com/domnulvlad/TLBFISLib/wiki)!** (work in progress...)

After completing the hardware setup detailed on the wiki, there are a few demo sketches you can access by navigating to `File -> Examples -> TLBFISLib` in the Arduino IDE.
